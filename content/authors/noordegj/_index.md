Julia Noordegraaf is professor of Digital Heritage at the Faculty of Humanities, University of Amsterdam. She founded the research program and lab Creative Amsterdam that studies the history of urban creativity using digital data and methods. Her research focuses on the reuse of digital cultural heritage for historical research, exploring the epistemological and methodological implications of using digital sources and methods. In the context of the [European Time Machine project](https://www.timemachine.eu/), she coordinates the realization of the [Amsterdam Time Machine](https://www.amsterdamtimemachine.nl/): a 'Digital Twin' for location-based, personalized access to historical information on the city.
