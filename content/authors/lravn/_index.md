Louis Ravn is a PhD Candidate on the Deep Culture project. In this context, his research focuses on the intersection between deep learning and real-time digital archives, such as web archives and social media ecosystems. His background is in science and technology studies (STS). Previously, he was a Research Assistant at the University of Copenhagen, where he studied practices of archival data loss. His primary research interest lies in understanding the social implications of emerging AI and data technologies for digitalizing societies. Most recently, he has studied synthetic data from the perspectives of hype, surveillance, and evaluation. His research has been published in Big Data & Society, Internet Policy Review, and Surveillance & Society.
