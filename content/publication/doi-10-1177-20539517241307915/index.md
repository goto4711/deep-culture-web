abstract: ' Synthetic data, denoting artificially produced data that are used for
  data science tasks, are increasingly held as a promising solution to digital societies’
  predicaments. While burgeoning research has investigated the implications of synthetic
  data, the fabrication of synthetic data promises remains understudied. This article
  draws on the sociology of expectations and the concept of boundary work to interrogate
  emerging arenas of expectations and attendant boundary work practices through which
  synthetic data promises are fabricated. To this end, it draws from a wide range
  of empirical materials, including scientific literatures, promissory reports, industry
  webinars, and interviews. First, it shows that scientific literatures reveal a strong
  increase in interest and three transformations in the framing of synthetic data
  in recent decades: from vernacular term to scientific concept, from possibility
  to inevitability, and from research technique to social promise. Second, it demonstrates
  that promissory organizations’ reports on synthetic data are generically performative
  as they circulate widely and constitute a source of authority for various stakeholders.
  Finally, it highlights three types of boundary work in relation to synthetic data:
  stipulations of its epistemic superiority, negotiations concerning most apt methodologies,
  and contestations regarding whether synthetic data are “fake.” I conclude by arguing
  that a sociology of expectations approach can productively question the hyperbolic
  promises attributed to synthetic data. Overall, this article contributes to germinal
  social studies of synthetic data by highlighting the constitutive role of expectations
  and boundary work in the fabrication of synthetic data promises. '
