        Deep Culture is a five-year Advanced Grant funded by the European Research Council. The project proposes to is interested in deep learning technologies that have taken the worlds of commercial and academic AI by storm. ChatGPT has generated a lot of excitement about our new relations with AI but has also revealed much public anxiety around deep learning. There is too little understanding of the fundamental shift in cultural relations deep learning has brought about. The project coins the term ‘deep culture’ to describe the global transformations that deep learning has wrought on culture and how culture is in turn key to deep learning. Neither overly enthusiastic nor despairing about the new deep culture, the project proposes reshaping our relationships with it to address the complexities of cultures and values of difference. The project will first explore epistemic translations between deep learning and historical-cultural concepts and practices. Secondly, it will work with deep-learning methods to address their limitations for critical analysis. Finally, it aims to produce diverse public understandings of deep learning’s global relations to culture.
